Issues :-

Live stream starts with a latency of about 5 seconds.

The live stream ends after the duration of 10 seconds.

The camera has to be rebooted after every live stream session ends. i.e cannot initiate back to back streams without reebot.

battery backup of gopro on stream cannot be relied on as it lasts max of 1 hour on full charge.
